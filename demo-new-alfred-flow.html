So there's something from the time you were a kid to today, that has stopped you from taking the action you know you're capable of. This is the emotional splinter weed we're looking to pull out.

            <div class="step-prompt">"Thank you for sharing. I believe as kids we're these carefree beings full of confidence about what's possible. But as we grow up, we have experiences that convince us otherwise. They cause us to doubt ourselves. They make taking action feel unsafe. I believe this moment you identified is one of those moments. Thinking back to what you felt — the <span class="variable">{{post_event_feeling}}</span> — what made you feel that?"</div>

            <div class="step-title">Biology Lesson</div>
            <div class="step-prompt">"Can I let you in on a secret about human biology that's a little bit crazy once you realise? Quick biology lesson: • Your emotions are processed by your amygdala (an old part of the brain). • Your thoughts are processed by your prefrontal cortex (a new part of the brain). • They don't speak the same language. It's like the amygdala speaks French (emotions) and your prefrontal cortex speaks Chinese (words). So when your amygdala feels unsafe… your prefrontal cortex doesn't know the real reason, so it does its best to guess. Your answer — <span class="variable">{{logical_reasons_list}}</span> — is that best guess. But the truth is it's this experience of <span class="variable">{{splinter_event_description}}</span>. Your amygdala hated feeling the <span class="variable">{{post_event_feeling}}</span> so much, it now doesn't feel safe doing anything that might cause <span class="variable">{{splinter_identity_verdict}}</span> again. It sets off an 'inner alarm' every time you think about taking action. Your mind then justifies that feeling through logical reasons like <span class="variable">{{logical_reasons_list}}</span>. Does this make sense?"</div>

            <div class="step-prompt">"The good news? As if it were magic, once we 'release' the emotional splinter this experience created, all those reasons the prefrontal cortex identified will also disappear. You'll simply believe you're capable of these things without any doubts. This 'release' is the first part of healing this wound. If you're interested to learn the best tools to release this emotional splinter, enter your email. I'll share techniques that you can do yourself and other ways that I recommend doing with practitioners.

            <div class="step-prompt">"The second part of healing this wound is to 'rewire'.

In addition to creating an 'inner alarm', it developed protective armour. This armour is a protective pattern — a way to behave to ensure it doesn't happen again.
