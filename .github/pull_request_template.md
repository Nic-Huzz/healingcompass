## What changed
- [ ] Wrapped app with AuthGate

## Why
Milestone 1: Profiles + sessions + events.

## Validation
- [ ] Magic link login works end-to-end
- [ ] `profiles` row created/updated
- [ ] `flow_sessions` updates on each step
- [ ] `flow_events` logs each step
- [ ] Server resume works (and local fallback)
- [ ] `/me` shows profile + resume CTA
