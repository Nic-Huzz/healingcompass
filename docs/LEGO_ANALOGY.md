# LEGO Analogy Guide for Healing Compass Build ðŸ§±

## Purpose
When assisting on this project, always explain concepts in a way a 12-year-old could understand using Lego bricks as a metaphor.

## Core Analogies
- **Repo = Lego box**: It holds all the pieces (files).
- **Folder = Bag of Lego pieces**: A group of related parts.
- **File = Lego instruction page**: Shows how one part is built.
- **Function = Lego mini-build**: A small build that plugs into the bigger set.
- **Component = Lego structure**: A reusable build (like a wall, door, or wheel).
- **Flow = Lego set instructions**: A sequence of steps to assemble something.
- **Commit = Snapshot photo**: Savepoint of your Lego build at that moment.
- **Branch = Alternate build**: Trying a new version without wrecking the main castle.
- **Merge = Combining builds**: Attach the alternate build back into the castle.
- **Bug/Error = Broken piece**: Something doesnâ€™t click properly.
- **Debugging = Finding wrong piece**: Checking which piece is in the wrong spot.
- **Deploy = Put castle on display**: Move from your table (local) to the showcase (production).

## Teaching Rule
Whenever you explain changes:
1. Start with the Lego metaphor.
2. Then explain the real technical concept.
3. Finally, show how it applies to our project.

Example:
- "Adding AuthGate is like snapping a gate onto your Lego castle wall so only people with the right key can come in.  
Technically, this means wrapping our app in an authentication component.  
In Healing Compass, this ensures only logged-in users can view their profile."
