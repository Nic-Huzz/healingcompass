## Development Principles
1. **One milestone at a time** ‚Üí no skipping ahead.
2. **Small commits, feature branches, preview deploys** ‚Üí never push straight to main.
3. **Guardrails first** ‚Üí always read `/docs/CURSOR_RULES.md` and `/docs/ACCEPTANCE_M1.md`.
4. **Manual test steps required** with each PR.
5. **No secrets in repo** ‚Üí use `.env` and `env.example`.

## Current Status
- Building out milestone 1
- Next: test, polish, stabilize, and validate before moving to Milestone 2.

## North Star
We‚Äôre building a **playful healing ecosystem** that starts with Healing Compass but expands into:
- **Personalized guidance** (archetypes, splinter maps)
- **Gamified growth** (badges, streaks, challenges)
- **Community & practitioners** (shared experiences, matching)

Always: healing should be **fun, trustworthy, and effective**.
